# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE_NAME]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Specification**: [Relative link to `spec.md`]  
**Input Source**: `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Generated By**: `/speckit.plan`  
**Execution Workflow**: `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md`

---

## Summary

> Concise synthesis of:
> - Primary feature requirement
> - Chosen technical approach
> - Key constraints and risks

This section MUST be derived directly from the feature specification and validated research.  
No new requirements may be introduced here.

---

## Technical Context

> This section defines the **concrete execution environment**.
> All `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers MUST be resolved before Phase 1 completes.

**Language / Version**: [e.g., Python 3.12 | NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, SQLAlchemy | NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, filesystem, N/A]  
**Testing Framework**: [e.g., pytest | NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, Docker container]  
**Project Type**: [single | web | mobile | library]  
**Performance Goals**: [explicit, measurable targets or NONE]  
**Constraints**: [latency, memory, security, offline, policy limits]  
**Scale / Scope**: [expected load, data volume, user count]

No field may be left ambiguous without an explicit marker.

## Constitution Check

> **GATE — MUST PASS before Phase 0 research begins**  
> Re-evaluate after Phase 1 design.

Applicable constitutional articles:
- [Article I: Specification Supremacy]
- [Article II: Test-First Enforcement]
- [Article III: Contract-First Design]
- [Article V: Simplicity & Anti-Abstraction]

**Status**:
- ☐ Passes all articles
- ☐ Violations present (must be documented in *Complexity Tracking*)

Agents MAY NOT proceed to implementation planning unless this gate is satisfied.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (Feature Scope)

```text
specs/[###-feature-name]/
├── spec.md            # Feature specification (source of truth)
├── plan.md            # This file (/speckit.plan output)
├── research.md        # Phase 0: research & tradeoffs
├── data-model.md     # Phase 1: schemas & entities
├── quickstart.md     # Phase 1: validation scenarios
├── contracts/        # Phase 1: API / skill / data contracts
└── tasks.md          # Phase 2: execution tasks (/speckit.tasks)
```
## Source Code Structure (Repository Root)

**This structure is mandatory and must not be altered.**

### ACTION REQUIRED
- Select **ONE** structure
- Remove all unused options
- Expand the chosen structure with **real paths only**

---

### Option 1: Single Project (DEFAULT)

```text
src/
├── models/
├── services/
├── skills/
├── cli/
└── lib/

tests/
├── contract/
├── integration/
└── unit/
```

### Option 2: Web Application (Frontend + Backend)

```text
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   └── api/
└── tests/

frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── services/
└── tests/

```

### Option 3: Mobile + API

```text
api/
└── [same structure as backend]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific modules, UI flows, platform tests]


```

### Structure Decision

[Explain why this structure was chosen and how it aligns with the constitution and constraints.]

### Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0 — Research

Library and dependency evaluation

Performance and security considerations

Tradeoff analysis

Output: research.md

### Phase 1 — Design

Data models and schemas

API / skill / CLI contracts

Validation scenarios

Outputs:

data-model.md

contracts/

quickstart.md

### Phase 2 — Task Derivation

Convert plan artifacts into executable tasks

Identify safe parallelization groups

Output: tasks.md (generated by /speckit.tasks)

## Complexity Tracking

Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations

Violation	Why Needed	Simpler Alternative Rejected Because
[e.g., >3 projects]	[current necessity]	[why simpler structure fails]
[e.g., custom abstraction]	[specific requirement]	[why direct approach insufficient]

If this table is empty, no violations exist.

## Plan Status

Ready for Task Generation: ☐ YES ☐ NO

Blocking Issues: [List or NONE]
