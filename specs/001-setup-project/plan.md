# Implementation Plan: Project Initialization

**Branch**: `001-setup-project`
**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Specification**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input Source**: `/specs/001-setup-project/spec.md`

**Generated By**: `/speckit.plan`
**Execution Workflow**: MANUAL / AGENTIC

---

## Summary

This plan outlines the initialization of the Project Chimera infrastructure in accordance with the project Constitution. The primary goal is to establish the mandatory "Specification-Driven Development" environment, including the directory structure (`specs/`, `src/`, `tests/`), configuration of the `SpecKit` toolchain (which is partially present), and verification of the environment using the included scripts.

The technical approach involves using standard file system operations and Bash scripts, as defined in `check-prerequisites.sh`.

---

## Technical Context

**Language / Version**: N/A (Project Structure & Bash Scripts)
**Primary Dependencies**: Git, Bash
**Storage**: Filesystem
**Testing Framework**: Custom scripts (`.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh`)
**Target Platform**: Local Development Environment (Windows/Linux/Mac)
**Project Type**: Infrastructure / Scaffold
**Performance Goals**: NONE
**Constraints**: Must match the structure expected by `.specify/scripts/bash/common.sh`.
**Scale / Scope**: Single repository setup.

---

## Constitution Check

Applicable constitutional articles:
- [Article I: Specification Supremacy] - We are creating the `specs/` folder to enable this.
- [Article II: Test-First Enforcement] - We will verify setup with `check-prerequisites.sh`.
- [Article V: Checklists & Safety] - We will establish the `checklists/` directory.

---

## Phase 1: Specifications & Documentation

> **Goal**: Establish the "Specification Supremacy" root of trust.

- [ ] Create `ChimeraProject/specs/` directory.
- [ ] Create `ChimeraProject/specs/001-setup-project/` for self-bootstrapping.
- [ ] Ensure `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `research.md` exist in the feature directory.

## Phase 2: Core Project Structure

> **Goal**: scaffolding for code and tests.

- [ ] Create `ChimeraProject/src/` directory.
- [ ] Create `ChimeraProject/tests/` directory.
- [ ] Create `ChimeraProject/checklists/` directory.
- [ ] Ensure `.specify/` folder integrity (already present).

## Phase 3: Infrastructure Verification

> **Goal**: Prove that the environment is compliant.

- [ ] Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh`.
- [ ] Verify that Git is initialized (if not already).

- [Article III: Contract-First Design]
- [Article V: Simplicity & Anti-Abstraction]

**Status**:
- ☐ Passes all articles
- ☐ Violations present (must be documented in *Complexity Tracking*)

Agents MAY NOT proceed to implementation planning unless this gate is satisfied.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (Feature Scope)

```text
specs/[###-feature-name]/
├── spec.md            # Feature specification (source of truth)
├── plan.md            # This file (/speckit.plan output)
├── research.md        # Phase 0: research & tradeoffs
├── data-model.md     # Phase 1: schemas & entities
├── quickstart.md     # Phase 1: validation scenarios
├── contracts/        # Phase 1: API / skill / data contracts
└── tasks.md          # Phase 2: execution tasks (/speckit.tasks)
```
## Source Code Structure (Repository Root)

**This structure is mandatory and must not be altered.**

### ACTION REQUIRED
- Select **ONE** structure
- Remove all unused options
- Expand the chosen structure with **real paths only**

---

### Option 1: Single Project (DEFAULT)

```text
src/
├── models/
├── services/
├── skills/
├── cli/
└── lib/

tests/
├── contract/
├── integration/
└── unit/
```

### Option 2: Web Application (Frontend + Backend)

```text
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   └── api/
└── tests/

frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── services/
└── tests/

```

### Option 3: Mobile + API

```text
api/
└── [same structure as backend]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific modules, UI flows, platform tests]


```

### Structure Decision

[Explain why this structure was chosen and how it aligns with the constitution and constraints.]

### Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0 — Research

Library and dependency evaluation

Performance and security considerations

Tradeoff analysis

Output: research.md

### Phase 1 — Design

Data models and schemas

API / skill / CLI contracts

Validation scenarios

Outputs:

data-model.md

contracts/

quickstart.md

### Phase 2 — Task Derivation

Convert plan artifacts into executable tasks

Identify safe parallelization groups

Output: tasks.md (generated by /speckit.tasks)

## Complexity Tracking

Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations

Violation	Why Needed	Simpler Alternative Rejected Because
[e.g., >3 projects]	[current necessity]	[why simpler structure fails]
[e.g., custom abstraction]	[specific requirement]	[why direct approach insufficient]

If this table is empty, no violations exist.

## Plan Status

Ready for Task Generation: ☐ YES ☐ NO

Blocking Issues: [List or NONE]
